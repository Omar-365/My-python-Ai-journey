# My-python-Ai-journey
This repository documents my learning journey in Python, Data Science, and AI.
It includes all tasks, homework, exercises, and projects I completed during my course â€” from Python basics to building my first AI models.

The repo is structured to reflect my progress step by step:

âœ… Python fundamentals & OOP concepts

âœ… Final OOP project: Library Management System

âœ… Data analysis with NumPy & pandas

âœ… Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

âœ… End-to-end projects (Titanic, Housing price prediction)

ðŸš€ Machine learning models (regression, classification, first AI models)
